<h5><p>
<br>To you who'd read my songs of War
<br>And only hear of blood and fame,
<br>I'll say (you've heard it said before)
<br>'War's Hell! ' and if you doubt the same,
<br>Today I found in Mametz Wood
<br>A certain cure for lust of blood:
<br>
<br>Where, propped against a shattered trunk,
<br>In a great mess of things unclean,
<br>Sat a dead Boche; he scowled and stunk
<br>With clothes and face a sodden green,
<br>Big-bellied, spectacled, crop-haired,
<br>Dribbling black blood from nose and beard
