<br>I really can't stay
<br>But, baby, it's cold outside
<br>I got to go away
<br>But baby, it's cold outside
<br>This evening has been
<br>Been hoping that you'd drop in
<br>So very nice
<br>I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
<br>
<br>My mother will start to worry
<br>Beautiful, what's your hurry?
<br>And father will be pacing the floor
<br>Listen to the fireplace roar
<br>So really I'd better scurry
<br>Beautiful, please don't hurry
<br>Well, maybe just a half a drink more
<br>Put some records on while I pour
<br>
<br>The neighbors might think
<br>But baby, it's bad out there
<br>Say, what's in this drink?
<br>No cabs to be had out there
<br>I wish I knew how
<br>Your eyes are like starlight now
<br>To break the spell
<br>I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
<br>
<br>I ought to say no, no, no, Sir
<br>Mind if I move in closer
<br>At least I'm gonna say that I tried
<br>What's the sense of hurting my pride?
<br>I really can't stay
<br>Oh, baby don't hold out, baby
<br>Ahh, but it's cold outside
<br>
<br>I simply must go
<br>But, baby, it's cold outside
<br>The answer is no
<br>But, baby, it's cold outside
<br>This welcome has been
<br>How lucky that you dropped in
<br>So nice and warm
<br>Look out the window at that storm
<br>
<br>My sister will be suspicious
<br>Gosh, your lips look delicious
<br>My brother will be there at the door
<br>Waves upon a tropical shore
<br>My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
<br>Gosh, your lips are delicious
<br>Well, maybe just a cigarette more
<br>Never such a blizzard before
<br>
<br>I've got to get home
<br>But, baby, you'll freeze out there
<br>Say, lend me a comb
<br>It's up to your knees out there
<br>You've really been grand
<br>I thrill when you touch my hand
<br>But don't you see
<br>How can you do this thing to me?
<br>
<br>There's bound to be talk tomorrow
<br>Think of my life long sorrow
<br>At least there will be plenty implied
<br>If you caught pneumonia and died
<br>I really can't stay
<br>Get over that old out, baby
<br>Ahh, but it's cold outside
<br>
<br>Where could you be going
<br>When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?
<br>Baby, it's cold, cold outside
