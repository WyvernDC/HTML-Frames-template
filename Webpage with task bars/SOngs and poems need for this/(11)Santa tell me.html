<br>Santa, tell me if you're really there
<br>Don't make me fall in love again
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>Santa, tell me if he really cares
<br>'Cause I can't give it all away
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>
<br>Feeling Christmas all around
<br>And I'm trying to play it cool
<br>But it's hard to focus when I see him walkin' 'cross the room
<br>"Let it Snow" is blasting out
<br>But I won't get in the mood
<br>I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
<br>It's true love that he thinks of
<br>So next Christmas
<br>I'm not all alone, boy
<br>Santa, tell me if you're really there
<br>Don't make me fall in love again
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>Santa, tell me if he really cares
<br>'Cause I can't give it all away
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>
<br>I've been down this road before
<br>Fell in love on Christmas night (ooh, babe)
<br>But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
<br>Now I need someone to hold
<br>Be my fire in the cold (yeah, yeah)
<br>But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
<br>Or if it's true love that he thinks of
<br>So next Christmas
<br>I'm not all alone, babe
<br>Santa, tell me if you're really there
<br>Don't make me fall in love again
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>Santa, tell me if he really cares
<br>'Cause I can't give it all away
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>
<br>Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
<br>On the 25th by that fire place, oh-oh-oh
<br>But I don't want a new broken heart
<br>This year I've got to be smart
<br>Ooh, baby
<br>(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
<br>If he will be, if he will be here (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
<br>Oh-oh-oh
<br>
<br>Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa, tell me, 'cause I really care)
<br>Don't make me fall in love again
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, tell me, boy)
<br>'Cause I can't give it all away
<br>If he won't be here next year
<br>
<br>Santa, tell me if you're really there (tell me, tell me, baby)
<br>Don't make me fall in love again
<br>If he won't be here next year (if he won't be, if he won't be here)
<br>Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, do you care?)
<br>'Cause I can't give it all away
<br>If he won't be here next year
