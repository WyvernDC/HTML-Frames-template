  <p><h5>
  <br>I dreamt a dream! What can it mean?
  <br>And that I was a maiden Queen
  <br>Guarded by an Angel mild:
  <br>Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!
  <br>
  <br>And I wept both night and day,
  <br>And he wiped my tears away;
  <br>And I wept both day and night,
  <br>And hid from him my heart's delight.
  <br>
  <br>So he took his wings, and fled;
  <br>Then the morn blushed rosy red.
  <br>I dried my tears, and armed my fears
  <br>With ten-thousand shields and spears.
  <br>
  <br>Soon my Angel came again;
  <br>I was armed, he came in vain;
  <br>For the time of youth was fled,
  <br>And grey hairs were on my head.
