<h5><p>
<br>Every moment I spent with you
<br>Was like a beautiful dream come true
<br>It was the best dream I ever saw
<br>More colorful than a rainbow
<br>Your pretty voice is echoing in my ear
<br>The splendid sound I ever hear
<br>No Nightingale’s song
<br>Can compare to your glamorous tone
<br>Those alighting brown eyes
<br>As bright as twinkling stars in the sky
<br>I always wanted to hold your hand
<br>Between my arms close to my heart
<br>I could realize that was just a daydream.
<br>My wish was to hug you hard
<br>And listen to the beat of your heart
<br>
<br>I can still feel your smell
<br>The wonderful charming spell
<br>You taught me about love
<br>Your love made my life alive
<br>Whenever I see your face
<br>My whole heart fills with grace
<br>My life was like a dark cold night
<br>You were the only luminaire warming light
<br>My dream was to see your smile
<br>And walk with you all over this glorious isle
<br>You were the queen of my dream worlds
<br>I don’t know how to explain my feelings in words
<br>But, when you leave me alone with the feeling of spleen
<br>I could realize that was just a daydream
