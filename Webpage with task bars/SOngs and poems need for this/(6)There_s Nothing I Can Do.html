<h5><p>

<br>Never got the courage to come and tell you how I feel,
<br>Just couldn’t find the strength to let my emotions spill.
<br>Always saw you walking past,
<br>No-one’s ever put a smile on my face so fast.
<br>
<br>I regret not talking to you with all my heart,
<br>Knowing that now we are forever apart.
<br>I wish we could have been friends,
<br>Because you were a rare kind of person that God sends.
<br>
<br>Well you’re gone now forever,
<br>Not talking to you wasn’t clever.
<br>I guess God wanted you,
<br>And there’s nothing I can do.
