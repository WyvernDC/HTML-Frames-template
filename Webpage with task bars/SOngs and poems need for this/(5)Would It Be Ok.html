<h4><p>

<br>Would it be ok if I took some of your time?
<br>Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?
<br>
<br>Would it be ok if I opened my heart?
<br>Would it be ok if I took on the part
<br>
<br>Of being your man and showed you a view,
<br>One that only a real man could do?
<br>
<br>Would it be ok if I could make you smile?
<br>Would it be ok if I held you awhile?
<br>
<br>Would it be ok if I kissed your face?
<br>Would it be ok if I were to replace
<br>
<br>All the men in your past that just wouldn't do
<br>And vow to be faithful and always be true?
<br>
<br>Would it be alright to look in your eyes?
<br>Would it be alright to never tell lies?
<br>
<br>Would it be alright to find a way?
<br>Would it be alright to long for the day
<br>
<br>To pull you close and whisper in your ear
<br>And tell you our feelings are nothing to fear?
<br>
<br>Would it be ok if I took some of your time?
<br>Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme?
<br>
<br>To tell you there's nothing I'd rather do
<br>Than spend my whole life loving only you...
