<br>I'll give it to someone special
<br>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

<br>
<br>Once bitten and twice shy
<br>I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
<br>Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
<br>Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
<br>"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
<br>With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
<br>Now I know what a fool I've been
<br>But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
