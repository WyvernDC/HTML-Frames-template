<br>The snow's coming down
<br>(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
<br>(Christmas) Lots of people around
<br>(Christmas) Baby, please come home
<br>
<br>The church bells in town
<br>(Christmas) All ringing in song
<br>(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
<br>(Christmas) Baby, please come home
<br>
<br>They're singing "Deck The Halls"
<br>But it's not like Christmas at all
<br>'Cause I remember when you were here
<br>And all the fun we had last year
<br>
<br>Pretty lights on the tree
<br>(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
<br>(Christmas) You should be here with me
<br>(Christmas) Baby, please come home
<br>
<br>They're singing "Deck The Halls"
<br>But it's not like Christmas at all
<br>'Cause I remember when you were here
<br>And all the fun we had last year
<br>
<br>If there was a way
<br>(Christmas) I'd hold back this tear
<br>(Christmas) But it's Christmas day
<br>(Please) Please (please), please
<br>(Please) Please (please), please
<br>(Please) Please (please), please
<br>(Please) Baby, please come home
<br>
<br>Baby, please come home
<br>(Christmas) Baby, please come home
<br>(Christmas) Baby, please come home
<br>(Christmas) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
<br>(Christmas) I need you, I need you
<br>(Christmas) Please come home
